            <h1>GULING FULING</h1>
            <p>Guling-Guling Festival is a traditional occasion that happens yearly in the month of February in Paoay, Ilocos Norte. It is held before the Ash Wednesday or the start of the season of Lent or also known as “Semana Santa”, which begins 40 days prior to Easter. It is celebrated as a the last day of merry-making and enjoyment for the townspeople before the Lenten season. This festival in Paoay, Ilocos Norte was introduced by the Spanish friars in the 16th century during the olden days of the Spanish regime. It was celebrated by the religious sector as a way of interaction with their members. The word “guling” from Ilocano, means to mark or smear. The mayor in town would smear in the person’s forehead a cross sign that signifies the purity. They also believe that the mark in their forehead will cleanse all of their past sins. The cross is a white color made up of wet and white rice flour. This old tradition is celebrated for almost 400 years.</p>
