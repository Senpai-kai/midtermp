            <h1>MALACANANG OF THE NORTH</h1>
            <p>The residence was built by the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA; now the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority or TIEZA) in 1977 for Marcos's 60th birthday, and served as an official residence for the president's family when they were staying in Ilocos Norte. It is a two-story mansion overlooking the Paoay Lake, and consists of seven (supposedly a lucky number for Marcos) rooms, with each room having a theme of historical events from the Marcos era: Study, Agriculture, Diplomacy, OFW (overseas Filipino workers), Culture, Nation Building and Family.
            While being administered by TIEZA, Cecile Licad played a Frédéric Chopin program at the property in 2001.
            Usage of the property was turned over by the former president Benigno Aquino III to the Ilocos Norte provincial government in 2010.
            The Sandiganbayan anti-graft court stripped the Marcoses of the property in 2014, after it voided a 1978 agreement between Marcos and the then PTA, deciding that since it is a national park, Marcos had no legal rights over it since national parks are "inalienable public domain", despite claims by Bongbong Marcos, the son of the former president, that the property was owned by their family.</p>
